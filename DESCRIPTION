Description: Interval estimation of the population allele frequency from qPCR analysis based on the restriction enzyme digestion (RED)-DeltaDeltaCq method (Osakabe et al. 2017) as well as general DeltaDeltaCq analysis. Compatible with the Cq measurement on DNA extract from multiple individuals at once, so called "group-testing" because the model assumes the quantity of DNA extracted from an individual organism to follow a gamma distribution, thereby the point estimate is robust to the uncertainty of DNA yield.
