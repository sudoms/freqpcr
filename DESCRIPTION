Description: Interval estimation of the population allele frequency from qPCR analysis based on the restriction enzyme digestion (RED)-DeltaDeltaCq method (Osakabe et al. 2017), as well as general DeltaDeltaCq analysis. Compatible with the Cq measurement of DNA extracted from multiple individuals at once, so called "group-testing", this model assumes that the quantity of DNA extracted from an individual organism follows a gamma distribution. Therefore, the point estimate is robust regarding the uncertainty of the DNA yield.
